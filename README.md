# CSCI-360---Artificial-Intelligence
My own source code for the 3 projects of the Fall 2018 semester

Topics include Propositional Logic implementation for a Clue board game simulation, Simulated Annealing for a Puzzle generator, and A*/Adaptive A* for a Puzzle solving program.


#To run project 1:
Simply type "make" in terminal.

#To run project 2:
Simply type "make" in terminal. Within the makefile, you can change the dimensions and possible values of the puzzle being generated. Note that it will take up to 58 seconds to yield a result in the terminal. 

#To run project 3:
Type "make" in the terminal, and then "./GridPathPlanner" to run the executable.
